    <h2>Owl Alert TimePiece:</h2>
    <p>
        The OwlAlert TimePiece is a program that aims to keep track of student activities. 
        It’s made so that it can account for student attendance, 
        departures, and health needs using custom-made smartwatches. 
        Upon registering into a school, every student will be receiving an OwlAlert TimePiece smartwatch, 
        and all of their data will be stored in it. It will contain many features such as notifying both guardians and teachers, 
        assisting vendors in catering to every student’s allergies and health status as they make purchases from the canteen, 
        and so much more. Overall, our program shall remove the stepping stones and pave a better future in the education-technology industry.
